Each user can place multiple Orders, creating a one-to-many relationship between Users and Orders. The Orders table tracks important information like total amount and status. Finally, we have the Products table, which has a many-to-many relationship with Orders, allowing each order to contain multiple products and each product to be part of multiple orders.",
