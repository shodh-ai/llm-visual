    "script": "Let me explain the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for the 'Student' entity and its attributes.\n\n1. The central entity in this diagram is 'Student', representing a student in the system.\n\n2. The 'Student ID' is a key attribute, uniquely identifying each student. It is underlined to signify its primary key status.\n\n3. The 'Name' attribute is a composite attribute, meaning it can be broken down into sub-parts: 'First Name' and 'Last Name'. This structure allows for better data organization and retrieval.\n\n4. The 'Address' attribute is a simple attribute, as it is stored as a single value per student.\n\n5. The 'Age' attribute is a derived attribute, meaning it is not stored directly but is computed from other stored values like the student's date of birth.\n\n6. The 'Courses' attribute is a multivalued attribute, indicating that a student can enroll in multiple courses. This is shown using a double oval.\n\nThrough this ER model, we capture key aspects of a student's identity, relationships, and attributes efficiently.",
