Each site (Site 1, Site 2, Site 3, and Site 4) represents a server responsible for handling database requests.\n\n2. These sites are interconnected via a central Computer Network, enabling communication and data exchange between them.\n\n3. Each site has its own dedicated database (DB), meaning Site 1 manages DB1, Site 2 manages DB2, and so on.\n\nThis architecture ensures data distribution, redundancy, and fault tolerance, making it ideal for large-scale and geographically dispersed applications.",
