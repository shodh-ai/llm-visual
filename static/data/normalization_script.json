    "script": "Normalization is a systematic approach to organizing data in a relational database to reduce redundancy and maintain data integrity. We begin with First Normal Form (1NF), which ensures that each table cell contains a single, atomic value and that there are no repeating groups. Next, Second Normal Form (2NF) eliminates partial dependencies on a portion of a composite primary key, strengthening the logical structure. Third Normal Form (3NF) goes further by removing transitive dependencies, so non-key attributes don’t depend on other non-key attributes. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) refines 3NF by requiring every determinant to be a candidate key, handling any remaining anomalies. Fourth Normal Form (4NF) addresses multi-valued dependencies, ensuring that multiple independent attributes don’t create unnecessary duplication. Finally, Fifth Normal Form (5NF) resolves join dependencies, making sure the data remains properly decomposed without losing information. By gradually applying these forms, we build a robust database design that is efficient, consistent, and easier to maintain. You can click on any of the nodes in the animation to lean more about that specific form of normalization.",
